    <h2>Privacy policy</h2>
    This is the privacy policy for TrustyDrive, a Windows application that provides storage functionality over many
    cloud providers. This Privacy Policy may be updated and you can receive information about updates through this
    website, accessible via the app's Settings page. The latest version of the privacy policy is always at

    <h3>Usage of Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox and Google Drive by this app.</h3>
    This Windows application, TrustyDrive, manages several accounts from different storage providers, namely, Microsoft
    OneDrive, Dropbox and Google Drive. Once users have allowed access to their provider accounts (Dropbox, OneDrive or
    Google Drive), the TrustyDrive application creates one directory called "trustydrive" on every account. TrustyDrive
    only reads and writes files included in the "trustydrive" directory. TrustyDrive does not read other files stored on
    your account.
    <h3>Information collected or recorded</h3>
    First, no user data is transmitted to or stored on TrustyDrive servers. Credentials used to connect to cloud
    providers belong to the user side. Files saved from TrustyDrive are stored on cloud providers (Dropbox, Google
    Drive, Microsoft OneDrive).
    <h3>Contact Information</h3>
    If you have any questions about this policy, please e-mail <b>contact@trustydrive.com</b>.
